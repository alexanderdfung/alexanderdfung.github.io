Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ I am a research assistant in [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev)'s lab at MIT, combining fMRI and computational tools to understand the neural basis of language.

My current interests lie at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and systems neuroscience. Concretely, I seek **mathematical principles of computation in biological and artificial neural circuits**. I aim to develop mechanistically interpretable frameworks, addressing questions like:
- How can we extract meaningful structure from high-dimensional neural population data?
- Which learning rules and memory architectures might support efficient storage and accurate retrieval of information over the timecourses of learning?

Before coming to MIT, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology. I first fell in love with research while working on the protein folding problem with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) \[[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.16.512436v1)\] \[[PSB2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890133/)\]. In my current position with Ev, I'm learning to integrate my computational skills with careful experimental design \[[Neuropsychologia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393225000600)\] \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/fung2024wordorder.pdf)\] \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/kean2024deductiveinductive.pdf)\]. My research journey thus far has only been possible because of the wonderful mentorship I've received.
