Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ I work as a research assistant in [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev)'s lab at MIT, combining fMRI and computational tools to understand the neural basis of language.

<!-- I will be applying to PhD programs this fall! Going forward, my research interest is broadly in theoretical neuroscience, in particular computational principles of memory:
- How do our brains efficiently encode a lifetime of experiences such that relevant knowledge can be instantly recalled with the right trigger?
- Why are human representations seemingly more noise-invariant than machine representations?

I seek to address these questions with mathematical modeling of neural dynamics. -->

I will be applying to PhD programs this fall! Going forward, my research interest is broadly in theoretical neuroscience, in particular computational principles of memory. How do our brains efficiently encode a lifetime of experiences such that relevant knowledge can be accurately recalled with the right trigger? I seek to address this question on multiple levels:
- **Representational**: How can we characterize the memory efficiency, noise-invariance, and connectedness of human and machine representations?
- **Dynamic**: How do representations change over the timescales of learning?

In order to address these questions, I plan to leverage techniques across the spectrum of modern neuroscience: computational analysis of neural networks, mathematical modeling of neural dynamics, and the goal-directed experimentation necessary to get high-quality data. 

Before coming to EvLab, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology. I first fell in love with research while working on the protein folding problem with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). It was with [Kristofer Bouchard](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/kristofer-e-bouchard/) that I learned to properly analyze neural data. In my current position with Ev, I've learned to integrate my computational skills with careful experimental design. I am deeply grateful to the wonderful mentors I've had throughout my research career -- it is thanks to them that I found something I can enjoy for the rest of my life.
