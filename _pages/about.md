Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ I work as a research assistant in [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev)'s lab at MIT, combining fMRI and computational tools to understand the neural basis of language.

I will be applying to PhD programs this fall! I am broadly interested in **mathematical properties of the fundamental computations underlying intelligence**:
- Memory: How do memory architectures constrain and support efficient storage and accurate retrieval of information?
- Dynamics: How do our brains generate and utilize the low-dimensional structure observed in neural population dynamics as a substrate for inference?
- Learning: What are the biological learning rules responsible for encoding inferred representations into memory?

<!-- Going forward, my research interest is broadly in **theoretical neuroscience, in particular computational principles of memory**. How do our brains efficiently encode a lifetime of experiences such that relevant knowledge can be accurately recalled with the right trigger? I seek to address this question on multiple levels:
- Representational: How can we characterize the memory efficiency, noise-invariance, and connectedness of human and machine representations?
- Dynamical: How do representations change over the timescales of learning? -->


To address these questions, I plan to leverage techniques across the spectrum of modern neuroscience: computational analysis of neural networks, mathematical modeling of neural dynamics, and goal-directed experimentation.

Before coming to EvLab, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology. I first fell in love with research while working on the protein folding problem with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) \[[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.16.512436v1)\] \[[PSB2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890133/)\]. With [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/people/), I learned to properly analyze neural data. In my current position with Ev, I'm learning to integrate my computational skills with careful experimental design \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/fung2024wordorder.pdf)\] \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/kean2024deductiveinductive.pdf)\]. My research journey thus far has only been possible because of the wonderful mentorship I've received.
