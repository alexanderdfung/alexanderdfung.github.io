Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ I am a research assistant in [Ramon Nogueira](https://neurobiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/ramon-nogueira-manas)'s lab at UChicago, bridging machine learning and geometric approaches for neural data analysis.

My current interests lie at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and systems neuroscience. Concretely, I seek **mathematical principles of computation in biological and artificial neural circuits**. I aim to develop mechanistically interpretable frameworks, addressing questions like:
- How can we extract meaningful structure from high-dimensional neural population data?
- Which learning rules and memory architectures might support efficient storage and accurate retrieval of information over the timecourses of learning?

Before coming to UChicago, I was a research assistant with [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) at MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences studying language in brains and large language models \[[Neuropsychologia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393225000600)\] \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/fung2024wordorder.pdf)\]. I first fell in love with research as an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology, where I worked on the protein folding problem with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) \[[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.16.512436v1)\] \[[PSB2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890133/)\]. My research journey thus far has only been possible because of the wonderful mentorship I've received.
