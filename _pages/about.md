Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹. I work as a research assistant in [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev)'s lab at MIT, combining fMRI and computational tools to understand the neural basis of language.

I will be applying to PhD programs this fall! Going forward, my research interest is broadly in theoretical neuroscience, in particular computational principles of memory:
- How do our brains efficiently encode a lifetime of experiences such that relevant knowledge can be instantly recalled with the right trigger?
- Why are human representations seemingly more noise-invariant than machine representations?

I seek to address these questions with mathematical modeling of neural dynamics.

Before coming to EvLab, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology. I first fell in love with research while working in the computational biology space with [Yun Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). I thank [Kris Bouchard](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/kristofer-e-bouchard/) for teaching me how to study the brain, and how to make proper figures. Ev has been amazingly supportive and I cannot imagine a better mentor to have prepared me for a career in neuroscience.
