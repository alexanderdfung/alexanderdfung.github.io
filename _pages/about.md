Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ I work as a research assistant in [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev)'s lab at MIT, combining fMRI and computational tools to understand the neural basis of language.

I will be applying to PhD programs this fall! I am broadly interested in **theoretical neuroscience**, in particular **mathematical principles of low-level neural computations**. I would like to model biological data at the mechanistic level, addressing questions like:
- Which learning rules and memory architectures might support efficient storage and accurate retrieval of information over the timecourses of learning?
- What kinds of low-dimensional geometric and topological structures underlie neural population dynamics, and what can this tell us about the loss functions responsible for them?

To answer these questions, I plan to leverage techniques across the spectrum of modern neuroscience: computational analysis of neural networks, mathematical modeling of neural dynamics, and goal-directed experimentation.

Before coming to EvLab, I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Molecular & Cellular Biology. I first fell in love with research while working on the protein folding problem with [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/) \[[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.16.512436v1)\] \[[PSB2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890133/)\]. With [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/people/), I learned to properly analyze neural data. In my current position with Ev, I'm learning to integrate my computational skills with careful experimental design \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/fung2024wordorder.pdf)\] \[[CCN2024](https://alexanderdfung.github.io/assets/pdf/kean2024deductiveinductive.pdf)\]. My research journey thus far has only been possible because of the wonderful mentorship I've received.
